      "I've worked with few people able to bring the level of exactness and rigor that Nathan brings to his work. Nathan and I have worked together in a variety of roles over the last 10 years. He is process-driven, relentlessly refining and curating for greater efficiency and higher-quality outcomes. I’ve always appreciated his care for his craft and the continual learning and insights he brings to a team.",

      "I’ve had the opportunity to work with Nathan in different capacities for over 10 years, and specifically in his role as a software developer in the context of AudioVerse. He is meticulous, thoughtful, and easy to work with. He possesses a natural conscientiousness about the details, is forward-thinking about potential risks, and blends it all with a good sense of aesthetics. I’ve appreciated his can-do attitude, even with new ideas and technologies, and his willingness to collaborate with all stakeholders. His excellent communication skills are a real asset to complement his technical capabilities.",
